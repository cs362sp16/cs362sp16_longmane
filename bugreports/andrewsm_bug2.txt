Bug Report 2 for andrewsm

vc_bug1

The village card if found to fail to properly increment numActions when running a unit test.

The statement responsible for this is {state->numActions = state->numActions - 2;}

Severity - Moderate
This is moderately severe because it will happen every time this card is called and will have reprocussions for the "player".

Priority - Moderate
The priority for this is moderate because it is not catastrophic, and can be changed with literally one character, but it will always happen when this card is used.
