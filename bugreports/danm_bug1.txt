Bug Report 1 for danm

pc_bug1

the playCard() function fails when running the unit test on it and returns -1.

There is a boolean statement which will end up as true even when it shouldn't, that seems to be causing the problem.
The statement is: {(card < adventurer || card > treasure_map)} 

Severity - Moderate
While this can have an impact on the greater functionality of the game, not every situation will trigger this bug.
The game is still playable with it in place, it just causes small errors in the occasional round.

Priority - Low
Since this bug isn't catastrophic, isn't always triggered, is easily fixable, its priority is pretty low.
