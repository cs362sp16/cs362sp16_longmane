Unit Test 1:

My first unit test checks the shuffling function and returns errors if a player fails to have their hand shuffled. 

Unit Test 2:

The second test asses the functionality of buyCard, and ensure the user is able to buy them.

Unit Test 3:

Tests the functionality of drawCard, seeing that the whole function works properly.

Unit Test 4:

Tests the endTurn function and ensure it works as a whole also.

As a whole my tests tended to be successful becuase I had trouble coming up with
ways to get them to fail that would still be easily testible. I've learned a lot
from this assignment.
