Assignment 4

This was an interresting assignment and while I like the idea of differential testing, it was hard to tell who was "right" and who wasn't. 
Perhaps it could have been implemented better to help with that, but not with out serious effort.
This was also a less than ideal situation because the way dominion.c outputs results is ugly.
I was just barely able to reach 60% coverage on both dominons, with 62% on mine and 61% on the other.
